This site serves as a central hub for all OpenZebra projects \u2014 including device designs, software repositories, experimental protocols, and instructional resources. Why Zebrafish Larvae? Zebrafish larvae offer a rare balance in neuroscience research: they\u2019re genetically tractable, optically transparent, and small enough to study entire neural circuits in vivo. But working with them \u2014 especially at early developmental stages \u2014 often comes with technical and logistical challenges. Many commercial systems are expensive, overengineered, or difficult to adapt to new experiments. What began as a few isolated tools to help with my own experiments has since become a broader effort to make zebrafish research more modular, adaptable, and accessible. Purpose of This Site The goal of this site is to lower the barrier to entry for zebrafish-based neuroscience by sharing practical tools that are easy to build, modify, and understand. The projects here are documented (if applicable) with: Links to GitHub repositories Assembly instructions and CAD files Example use cases and data Teaching and outreach adaptations when available I\u2019ve tried to design these tools with the mindset that science should be both rigorous and approachable \u2014 not hidden behind proprietary walls or unnecessarily complex infrastructure. If you're a student, educator, researcher, or enthusiast, I hope you find something here that helps you move forward. Projects Agarose Stamping Method Standardized Immobilization for Zebrafish Larvae The agarose stamping method involves 3d-printable, reusable mold that creates patterned micro-wells in agarose gel for consistent and high-throughput immobilization of zebrafish larvae. It was developed to streamline the tedious and variable process of manually embedding larvae for imaging, stimulation, or behavior experiments. By changing the workflow from: agarose preparation -> larva alignment -> larva embedding -> post processing into: agarose stamp device preparation -> larva placement, the agarose stamping method improves reproducibility, reduces handling time, and is easy to teach or scale.

It supports real-time tracking, stimulus delivery (e.g., optokinetic), and \u2014 when desired \u2014 closed-loop control. The system is designed for modular use: tracking and stimulation can operate independently or in tandem, allowing researchers to adapt it to a variety of behavioral or neurophysiological paradigms. The platform is optimized for use with the agarose stamping method, which provides stable and reproducible animal positioning for high-quality data collection.
